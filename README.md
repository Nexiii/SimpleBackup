### A simple backup script made in Java. Made by Nexiii | Malte

### Requirements

### How to use:
1. Start *'run.bat'* it will create *'list.txt'* and a *'config.cfg'* and the program will close.
1. Open *'list.txt'* and add your directory adress (example *'C:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents'*)
2. Configure the config.cfg to your likings
3. Run the run.bat again
4. It will create a *'backups/'* folder in your directory and it will save it there
5. Done! That simple. 
6. Now you can upload it to a Cloud or automize it so once your PC starts it runs this Script.
